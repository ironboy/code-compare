**Java** (1994) and **C#** (2000) are fundamentally very similar. They are both strongly typed compiled languages ‚Äã‚Äãand share class-based OOP as a common starting point.

Microsoft designed **C#** as a direct response to, and to compete with, **Java**. Since they had something to compare with, some things became a little better/less verbose.

*Note:* In **C#**, unlike in **Java**, method names begin with a capital letter.

*These languages ‚Äã‚Äãprovide a safe, but somewhat rigid, suit for how you should code.* üëî

**Java** (Sun, 1994) and **JavaScript** (Netscape, 1994) are quite different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- despite the common "*Java*" in the name which comes from *Sun* and *Netscape* having a business partnership at the time and thinking it would be smart to promote **JavaScript** as the smaller sibling of **Java**.

**JavaScript** is a loosely typed language and originally had no class syntax.

For a long time (2015), however, there are classes in place in the language and if you want to, you can write it very traditionally and Java-like, minus data type declarations, like we have done here.

*Note*: In JavaScript, the constructor is always named *constructor* regardless of class name and **this** is a mandatory prefix when you access class members (fields and methods). ‚òï

**JavaScript** (1994) and **Python** (1991) are both loosely typed languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat can be written class-based, if you want to. Here are using the class based syntax, although the code will be slightly longer than if we were to write it without classes.

Whereas **JavaScript** has a basic syntax with curly brackets/braces for program blocks, semi-colons for line endings (optional/if desired), etc. similar to **Java** and **C#**, **Python** chooses to rely solely on indention in order to separate program blocks.

**Note:**
* In **JavaScript** we use *this.methodName* to refer to methods in the class. In **Python** we use *self.methodName* instead.
* In **Python** we must all methods in the class must to receive *self* as their first argument, but you omit this argument when you call them.
* The constructor of a class is called *constructor* in **JavaScript** and <span class="init-in-py">*__init__*</span> in **Python**.
* In **Python** we *do* not write **new** in front of the class name when creating a new instance of the class.
* In **Python** snake-casing is preferred, i.e. underscores, to separate words in the names of variables, methods and functions. In many other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(such as **Java**, **C#** and **JavaScript**) *camelCasing* is the default. üê´

**JavaScript** (1994) and **Python** (1991) are both loosely typed languages ‚Äã‚Äãand have in common that they are easy to "play" with data types in them, and that they only require a minimalistic syntax to create lists, hashmaps etc.

Whereas **JavaScript** has a basic syntax with curly brackets/braces for program blocks, semi-colons for line endings (optional/if desired), etc. similar to **Java** and **C#**, **Python** chooses to rely solely on indention in order to separate program blocks.

The languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan both be used with or without classes - here an example without classes in both languages, which results in shorter and more compact code.

(For better or wors **Python** has a slightly greater need for explicit type conversions than JavaScript.)

**JavaScript** was originally designed to run in browsers and complement **HTML** (a markup language) and **CSS** (a rules-based language for styling elements on web pages). Thus, it is natural that graphical interfaces in JavaScript programs are created with **HTML** and **CSS**.

**Python** has **TKinter** as its default GUI tool. It is a library built on top of **TK** (an open-source cross-platform tool) which is **widget**-based, ie. there are different kinds of graphic elements (*widgets*) - such as *labels/text*, *input fields* etc. to choose from to build the GUI.

This means that the approach to building graphical interfaces is quite different between the two languages. Even so, it is possible to create an example, like this one, where the code is comparable in structure and length.

*4 kilobytes of code x 2 should be enough for everyone?* üòõ

# 5
*Python's* **window handling** code is a bit longer than *JavaScript's*, as *Python* needs a function to start a so-called *Tkinter event loop* and show the window. On the other hand JavaScript needs a barebone HTML-file as its starting point.
