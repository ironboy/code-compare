**Java** (1994) and **C#** (2000) are fundamentally very similar. They are both strongly typed compiled languages ‚Äã‚Äãand share class-based OOP as a common starting point.

Microsoft designed **C#** as a direct response to, and to compete with, **Java**. Since they had something to compare it to, some things became a little better/less verbose.

*Note:* In **C#**, unlike in **Java**, method names begin with a capital letter.

*These languages ‚Äã‚Äãprovide a safe, but somewhat rigid, suit for how you should code.* üëî

**Java** (Sun, 1994) and **JavaScript** (Netscape, 1994) are quite different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- despite the common "*Java*" in the name which comes from *Sun* and *Netscape* having a business partnership and thought it would be smart to promote **JavaScript** as the little brother of **Java**.

**JavaScript** is a loosely typed language and originally had no class syntax.

For a long time (2015), however, there are classes in place in the language and if you want, you can write it very traditionally and Java-like, minus data type declarations, which we have done here.

*Note*: In JavaScript, the constructor is always named *constructor* regardless of class name and **this** is mandatory to access class members (fields and methods). ‚òï

**JavaScript** (1994) and **Python** (1991) are both loosely typed languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat can be written class-based, if desired. Here we do it, although the code will be slightly longer than if we were to ignore the classes.

Whereas **JavaScript** has a basic syntax with curly brackets/gullwings for program blocks, semi-colons for line endings (optional/if desired), etc. similar to **Java** and **C#**, **Python** chooses instead to use indentation to separate program blocks.

**Note:**
* In **JavaScript** we use *this.methodName* to refer to methods in the class. In **Python** we use *self.methodName* instead.
* In **Python** we must allow all methods in the class to receive *self* as an argument, but omit this argument when we call them.
* The constructor of a class is called *constructor* in **JavaScript** and <span class="init-in-py">*__init__*</span> in **Python**
* In **Python** we *do* not write **new** in front of the class name when creating a new instance of the class.
* In **Python** snake-casing is preferred, i.e. underscores, to separate words in variable, method and function names. In many other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(such as **Java**, **C#** and **JavaScript**) *camelCasing* is the default. üê´

**JavaScript** (1994) and **Python** (1991) are both loosely typed languages ‚Äã‚Äãand have in common that they are easy to "play" with data types in them, and they require minimal syntax to create lists, hashmaps etc .

Whereas **JavaScript** has a basic syntax with curly brackets/gullwings for program blocks, semi-colons for line breaks, etc. similar to **Java** and **C#**, **Python** chooses instead to use indentation to separate program blocks.

The languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan both be used with or without classes - here an example without classes in both languages, which results in shorter and more compact code.

(**Python** has, for better or worse, a slightly greater need for type conversions than JavaScript.)

*No fine suit needed, full load!* üéâ

**JavaScript** was originally designed to run in browsers and complement **HTML** (a content markup language) and **CSS** (a rules-based language for styling elements on web pages). Thus, it is natural that graphical interfaces for JavaScript programs are created with **HTML** and **CSS**.

**Python** has **TKinter** as its default GUI tool. It is a library built on top of **TK** (an open-source cross-platform tool) which is **widget**-based, ie. there are different kinds of graphic elements (*widgets*) - such as *labels/text*, *input fields* etc. to choose from to build their GUI.

This means that the approach to building graphical interfaces is quite different between languages. Even so, it is possible to create an example, like this one, where the code is comparable in structure and length.

*4 kilobytes of code x 2 should be enough for everyone?* üòõ

# 5
*Python's* **window handling** is a bit longer than *JavaScript's*, as *Python* needs a function to start a so-called *Tkinter event loop* and show the window. Here, the code is also versioned depending on the operating system. On the other hand, **Python** does not need an *html* file to start up, which **JavaScript** in a browser always does.
